# FastAPI + Forgeon

This example shows how to use FastAPI on Forgeon with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://forgeon.io/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://forgeon-fastapi.forgeon.io/

## How it Works

This example uses the Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) with FastAPI to enable handling requests on Forgeon with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Your FastAPI application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.
